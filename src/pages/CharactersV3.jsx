However, he always rather quickly reveals his evil nature by describing killing games and his desire for despair, and he is very well known for his habit to say and do whatever he wants to. He loves hysteria, violence, and chaos, summarized in one of his catchphrases 'thrills, chills, kills!'. He also has his own signature laughs, a sadistic 'puhuhu' ('upupupu' in the Japanese version) and a mocking 'ah-hahahaha'. In many ways, Monokuma represents duality both in design and personality, with his white good side and black evil side. He can sometimes act polite or cute and innocent, even patronizing, and during rare moments he even seems to give genuine positive and wise advice. However, he is mostly known for his malicious and cruel side, possessing a twisted sense of humor and a tendency to torment others and do anything for the sake of despair. He can switch between these traits at the drop of a hat, making him unpredictable for his students to deal with. He usually gets excited about the Class Trials and does everything he can in order to make them entertaining for himself.",

She also has a habit of speaking on behalf of Atua, and, strangely, these words can sometimes turn out to be very truthful. As another eccentric habit, she freely uses her own original Japanese, like 'Bye-yonara' or 'strange miracle', which shows a little bit of her artistic side. She also calls everyone by their first names in the Japanese version, which is considered eccentric since Japanese acquaintances typically refer to each other with their last names instead of their first names. However, in Angie's case, this seems to be because she's not a Japan-native.",

When he is accused of being the culprit, he answers with complete honesty even if it makes him look much more suspicious. He also does not seem to understand sexual matters very well, as after seeing a half-naked Miu he states he got a 'weird feelin', and he assumes being 'horny' means something like having horns on your head. Even his uncharacteristic 'keep you up all night' line during the Love Suite scene appears to be a case of misinformation. He himself acknowledges and often points out that he is dumb, which is one of the reasons why he listens to other people so much. Naturally, he strongly dislikes killing and cruelty, which can rather easily make him cry. However, despite his gentle nature, he can turn very angry if he sees or hears someone hating on insects, and he believes bug lovers can't be bad. Due to his strong love for bugs, he is often seen searching and yelling for them to come out, claiming that he wants to talk with them.",

During various situations, she tends to claim that she could use her magic to fix the problem, but she says she doesn't have enough MP. She also tends to take the credit in multiple situations, claiming it all happened thanks to her magic. Fitting her mage theme, she also uses a very notable outdated way of speaking, though this is not included in the English version. While all of this can make her appear self-centered, she has actually explained that one of the biggest reasons why she likes being a 'mage' is to make her audience happy and smile, especially children.",

His aim is to overcome being an ordinary robot and because of this, he may get offended if he is compared to much more simple machines. While generally well-mannered, he is quickly angered by any prejudice against robots and sometimes threatens to sue people who make 'discriminatory remarks'. He considers robots a minority group among humans and can get slightly paranoid about 'robophobia', supposedly because of past experiences. However, ironically, he himself is shown acting condescending and perpetrating 'robot-on-robot abuse' towards simpler machines such as the robots with Monokuma's likeness, considering them mere stuffed animals who are beneath him.",
