                    <p>The series revolves around an exclusive, government-funded high school called Hope's
                     Peak Academy which, every year, selects "Ultimate" students who are at the top of their 
                     field, and one average "Ultimate Lucky Student" who is chosen by lottery. However, when average 
                     student Makoto Naegi arrives at the school, he loses consciousness, and when he wakes up discovers
                     that he and his 14 classmates have been trapped within the school. Headmaster Monokuma, a 
                     sadistic robot bear, informs the students that they will be forced to live within the school
                     forever, with only one way to leave: murdering another student and getting away with it.

                     When a crime scene is discovered, a Class Trial is held, in which the remaining students must 
                     decide amongst themselves who the murderer is. If the students successfully discover the murderer,
                     the culprit will be executed, and the killing game continues. However, if they guess incorrectly, 
                     the culprit will be able to leave the school, but the other students will be executed.
