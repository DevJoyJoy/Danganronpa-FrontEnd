He is not interested in co-operating with others due to his own sense of self-superiority, and his opinion that others are, on the whole, lesser than him. This sense of superiority and black-and-white worldview comes as a result of his upbringing; Byakuya had to prove his worth in battle against his siblings in order to earn his role in the family as heir-apparent, whereas all his other siblings who lost the battle were effectively ex-communicated from the family and cut off financially, deemed 'unfit for the name of Togami'. Because Byakuya was raised in such a highly competitive environment of 'haves' and 'have-nots', he thinks all people only think about themselves and he dismisses emotional ties as petty and unimportant.",

He is rather serious, the one time he tries to joke around being an awkward and tone-deaf joke about Nagisa's trauma a moment after the child's supposed death. It's also implied that he was an abusive older brother towards his half-sister.",

Komaru shows some childish traits, such as being naive, reliant, and easily excitable. She also has an 'unusual' kind of pride, as she gets really worked up from the puzzles of the Monokuma Kids and brags towards the kids when she solves them. She is also very gullible, which is revealed when Toko says certain things that are obviously false, and Komaru easily believes them to be true. She is rather innocent as well and doesn't seem to have much interest in romance nor sexual thingsãƒ¼as a great contrast to Toko, she never seems to get flustered by handsome guys and just treats them like any other people.",

Even still, her speech is clear and focused, unlike in the case of Jataro Kemuri. Kotoko acts cheerful, polite and happy. However, she is mentioned to have a bullying nature and she can be very mean and cruel. She is very mean to Jataro, even more than the others are, and she likes to tease Nagisa Shingetsu.

He isn't above cheap insults or provoking. He appears to enjoy annoying Nagisa Shingetsu the most, most likely because of the boy's strict personality.

He is a perfectionist and suffers from a fear of abandonment as a result of his traumatic childhood. His prime goal in life has always been to exceed the expectations of the people around him in order to prove worth to both his parents and himself. As a result, placing any sort of expectations on him is somewhat of a 'trigger'. It propels him to try his best to exceed those expectations set for him, even at the expense of his own well-being and overall health.

He remains cheerful even during his self-loathing rambling, and acts disturbingly optimistically toward horrible things such as death, as long as it's for the sake of hope. Nagito likely suppresses any real feelings of sorrow or fear as a coping mechanism, because he experiences tragedy often due to his luck. He has also seen very unlikely and strange things due to his luck, which is why he is not easily surprised. As a result of everything he's been through, he has become more emotionally numb and he is rarely openly angry or scared. He often lacks appropriate emotions in situations where most people would be afraid, like threats of violence.
